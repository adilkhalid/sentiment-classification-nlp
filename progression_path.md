# Sentiment Analysis Model Progression

This document outlines a structured progression for building sentiment analysis models, starting from the most basic approaches and advancing to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

## ‚úÖ 1. Perceptron (with Bag of Words)
- **Why?** A simple linear model that serves as an introduction to machine learning for text classification.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Binary classification
  - Bag of Words (BoW) representation
- **Implementation:** Train a perceptron using BoW features.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Logistic Regression (with TF-IDF or BoW)
- **Why?** A probabilistic model that improves upon the perceptron by using a sigmoid activation function.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Logistic function
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Implementation:** Train a logistic regression classifier on BoW or TF-IDF features.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Word2Vec (CBOW/Skip-Gram)
- **Why?** Transforms words into vector representations that capture semantic meaning.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)
  - Skip-Gram
- **Implementation:** Train a Word2Vec model and use it to generate word embeddings.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. MLP (with Word2Vec)
- **Why?** A simple neural network that can learn patterns better than logistic regression.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Fully connected layers
- **Implementation:** Train an MLP using Word2Vec embeddings as input features.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- **Why?** Unlike MLPs, RNNs process text **sequentially**, preserving word order.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Hidden states
  - Time-dependent learning
  - Vanishing gradient problem
- **Implementation:** Train an RNN sentiment classifier using **Word2Vec** embeddings.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) / Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- **Why?** RNNs struggle with long sequences; LSTMs and GRUs fix this by introducing memory gates.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Forget, Input, and Output gates (LSTMs)
  - GRU simplifications
- **Implementation:** Train an **LSTM-based** model using **pretrained Word2Vec** embeddings.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Text
- **Why?** CNNs extract **local features** from text, making them effective for sentiment classification.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - 1D convolutions
  - Feature extraction in text
- **Implementation:** Train a CNN-based sentiment classifier using **Word2Vec** embeddings.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Transformer-Based Models (Self-Attention)
- **Why?** Transformers process words **in parallel** and capture long-range dependencies better than RNNs.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Self-attention mechanism
  - Multi-head attention
- **Implementation:** Implement a **Transformer Encoder** model (simpler than full transformers like BERT) for sentiment analysis.

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Pretrained Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
- **Why?** Pretrained transformers have been trained on massive datasets and achieve **state-of-the-art** results with fine-tuning.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
  - Fine-tuning vs. Feature Extraction
- **Implementation:** Fine-tune **BERT** on your sentiment dataset.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Large Language Models (LLMs) & Few-Shot Learning (GPT, T5, LLaMA)
- **Why?** Instead of training from scratch, these models allow **few-shot and zero-shot classification** with simple prompts.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Prompt engineering
  - Few-shot and zero-shot learning
- **Implementation:** Use **GPT-4, T5, or LLaMA** to classify sentiment **without fine-tuning**.
